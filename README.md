# NYC_Road_Accident_Analysis

Hello everyone!

Here I'm sharing my project "NYC Road Accident" done using Power BI tool. This is a project provided by CoachX.Live.

# 1. Data source 📋 : 

This dataset is an Excel file which is given by coachx for road accident analysis using PowerBi. It contains dataset of New York City Road accident. This includes the report of killed person, injured person, street name, vehicle types, dates of accidents, zip code of areas, accident types etc.

# 2. Data cleaning 🗑 : 

There is many null values, unwanted columns in this dataset. Replaced the null values with an identifying value so that we can recognize while making reports.

# 3. Visualizations 📊 : 

Provided some slicers for quarter, month, week, hour. Used Pie chart, tree map for a short overview of the dataset. Divided the dataset into 3 categories i.e., time base, geographical, contribution factor and vehicle type. Used all various types of charts like area chart, bar chart, table, stacked bar chart etc. Placed page navigator in every page for easy access to each page.
